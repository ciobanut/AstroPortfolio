  message: "Tudor was amazing—super responsive and incredibly helpful when I reached out about my Wordpress website troubles. His expertise was impressive, and his advice was spot-on, ultimately helping me solve the issues myself. What's more, he didn't even charge for his assistance—talk about a straight-up guy! Thanks a ton, Tudor!"

The main objective is to create a portfolio website that showcases some of Tudor's work in an attractive and concise way. It must also be clear to the visitor which programming languages Tudor knows. Also, the site should load as quickly as possible.
